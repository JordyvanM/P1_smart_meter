When this software is to be used, the [Nordic SDK] must be downloaded. The [s132.zip] folder containing the edited example code also must be downloaded and extracted. This folder must replace the existing s132 folder in nRF5_SDK_VERSION/examples/ble_peripheral/ble_app_uart/pca10040/. When this is done the replaced s132 folder can be openend, then open ses and then open the .emProject file. This will launch segger embedded studio and the programming of the desired board can begin.
